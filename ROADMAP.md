Roadmap for GoProgressQuest Front-End
=====================================

Adventuring
-----------

Implement a distinct MUD like display of the character levelling up, with continuously fetching information about the character via the server Get.

This display must also still allow the player to enter choices. The display will happen in a separate routine.
